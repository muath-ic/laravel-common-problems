# **Laravel 5.4: Specified key was too long error**

Laravel 5.4 made a change to the default database character set, and itâ€™s now utf8mb4 which includes support for storing emojis. This only affects new applications and as long as you are running MySQL v5.7.7 and higher you do not need to do anything.

>     [Illuminate\Database\QueryException]
>    SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes (SQL: alter table users add unique users_email_unique(email))
>
>    [PDOException]
>    SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1071 Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes 

To fix this all you have to do is edit your ```AppServiceProvider.php``` file and inside the boot method set a default string length:191

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

public function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
```
